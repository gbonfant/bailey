Bailey is a utility tool to help you find a new home in the crazy London real
state market.

## Running it

Bailey is meant to send property notifications using `postfix`, this is by
design, as the tool is not meant to send transactional email. Configuration is
up to the user but using a common, free SMTP provider (like Gmail) is advised.
